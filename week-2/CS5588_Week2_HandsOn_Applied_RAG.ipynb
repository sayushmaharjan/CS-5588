It clarifies that the system is more than a chatbot: it must combine real-time weather, historical climate context, and personalized reasoning for planning decisions. Writing this out pushes me to think like a product owner—who is using this, what pain points exist today, and how grounding responses with RAG (instead of pure generation) directly reduces the risk of misleading or unsafe advice.\n",

Instead of relying only on synthetic or benchmark data, I plan to use text derived from real public sources like NOAA and national weather agencies, plus internally curated “how to interpret weather” docs that match the product. Thinking about data ownership and sensitivity up front is critical: even though most weather and climate docs are public, I must still respect licensing and avoid accidentally treating personal user data as retrievable documents. This planning also shapes retrieval design (e.g., document chunking, metadata) because I know I’m working with long-form guides, regional climate summaries, and hazard-specific instructions.\n"

The cross-encoder checks each candidate chunk against the full query and promotes the ones that are truly relevant, which helps prevent near-duplicate or marginally related content from crowding out the best safety or climate explanation. For a weather product, this reduces the chance that a generic “outdoor tips” paragraph ends up above a specific “flash flood safety” paragraph when the user explicitly asks about floods at an event venue. Governance in this context means controlling information flow to the LLM so it is less likely to hallucinate or underplay risks due to weak or off-topic context."

Without the right climate explanation chunks, the generation layer (or the fallback evidence summary) can’t properly address the nuance of attribution, highlighting that better documents and possibly query expansion are needed for this user story."
