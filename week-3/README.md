### 0.1 Target user persona
- Who will use this? (role, context, pain point)

- Role: "Climate-Anxious Homeowner" or "Urban Renter."
- Environment: A city facing increasing climate volatility (e.g., Miami, Phoenix, or Jakarta).
- Pain Point: Generic weather apps give raw data (temperature/rainfall) but no context. Users don't know how a "2-inch rain event" translates to "my basement flooding" or how a "heatwave" impacts their specific building type.


### 0.2 Problem statement (1–2 sentences)
- What decision/task does your product support?

- Users cannot translate macro-level climate data into micro-level personal risks, leading to poor decisions regarding insurance, home safety, and daily commutes.


### 0.3 Value proposition (1 sentence)
- What improves (speed, accuracy, trust, cost, risk)?

- This module retrieves specific technical evidence (flood maps, building codes, climate models) and contextualizes it against the user's profile to deliver actionable, personal risk intelligence ("Your commute route crosses Zone X, which floods frequently").


### 0.4 Success metrics (pick 2–3)
- e.g., time-to-answer, citation coverage, % “not enough evidence” when missing, user satisfaction (1–5), precision@5

- Personalization Precision: % of retrieved results that are actually relevant to the user’s specific location/building type.
- Evidence Traceability: 100% of risk claims must cite a specific map zone, page in a climate report, or building code.
- Refusal Accuracy: System must refuse to predict risks for locations/buildings not covered in the documents (avoiding false safety assurances).
